YAC

    YAC is a basic CMS Design Pattern with a simple user interface. No
    need to learn perl to play the YAC but a monk can play so well.

    A CMS needs features , at least, to create, edit and publish content 
    and to ways to link that content as web address (urls) to navigation 
    or command menus and links. A good addon is a theme manager. The access 
    to the CMS and this features need to be defined at Access Control List. 
    The stronguest feature in the YAC's UI is a simple plugin system integrated 
    at cpan level.

    The idea, as the first implementation, is design around an extensible and 
    basic ajax structure implemnted in jquery from Catalyst. 
    See: Catalyst::View::Component::jQuery.

    As simple as an CMS can be, YAC implements a simple user interface
    around Catalyst helpers, open hooks and plugins. This open  design 
    encourage YAC's contributions grow.

    The most important pattern is the open user interface paradigma. The 
    idea about web interfaces can't neglect Ajax and the HTML 5 protocol.

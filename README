    YAC is a basic CMS Design Pattern with a simple user interface. No
    need to learn perl to play the YAC but a monk can play so well.

    A CMS needs features to create, edit, organize and publish content,
    ways to link and exchange the content in the web environment.
   
    As simple as an CMS can be, YAC implements a simple user interface
    around Catalyst helpers, open hooks and plugins. This open  design 
    encourage YAC's contributions grow.

    The most important pattern is the open user interface paradigma. The 
    idea about web interfaces can't neglect Ajax and the HTML 5 protocol.
